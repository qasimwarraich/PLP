### Note

Just want to explain some weirdness in my screenshots. when you see `C` being using on the command line just know that it is a shell alias for `./a.out`.

I really worked hard on this assignment and it required lots of research. C++ seems to be an infinitely deep void full of different options for implementations and approaches. I am sure there are better ways to implement everything but it is quite a challenge balancing the learning process of a new language and also managing the requirements of the assignments. I hope you appreciate the effort and I just wanted to say this seminar has been an extremely fascinating learning experience so far.
